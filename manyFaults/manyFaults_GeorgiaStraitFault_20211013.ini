description = Georgia Strait Rupture Scenarios using the 1997 Georgia Strait earthquake hypocentre and fault plane geometry from Cassidy, Rogers, & Waldhauser (2000, BSSA). These scenarios use a mapped crustal marine fault near Vancouver, but consider larger magnidue events than those that have been observed to date for that location. Maximum magnitude (7.5) is obtained from CanSHM6 for PUGET SOUND SHALLOW.
