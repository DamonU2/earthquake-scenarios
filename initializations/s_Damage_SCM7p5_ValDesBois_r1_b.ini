description = Ottawa planning scenario using the 2010 Val-de-bois, QC earthquake hypocentre and fault plane geometry from Ma & Motazedian, 2012 and Atkinson & Assatourians, 2010. This scenario uses a larger magnitude event than those that have been observed to date for that location, within bounds of the national seismic hazard model. Maximum magnitude of 7.95 is obtained from CanSHM6 for GATINEAU region.
